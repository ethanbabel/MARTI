# 🚀 Release Log

## 🔄 Updates

We have introduced new support for Async Tool Use in Agentic RL, and Async Workflow for Multi-Agent RL. This enables more flexible and efficient RL pipelines, supporting both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios.

Single Agent Tool Use
    - Steps
Modular step files for different tasks
  └─ xxx_step.py
    - Tools
Expanded toolset for agentic decision-making

Multi-Agent Workflow
    - Workflows
Support for orchestrating multi-agent environments
  └─ xxx_workflow.py (Multi-Agent orchestration)
    - Processors
For advanced reward shaping and feedback
  └─ xxx_processor.py (Reward Shaping)
